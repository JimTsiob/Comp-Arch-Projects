# Comp-Arch-Projects
## Computer Architecture assignments.

Goal of these 3 projects was to create a RISC-Architecture CPU and test it's functionality with the usage of Waveforms.

## First assignment

Create components structurally and implement an ALU with said components.

## Second assignment

Create the first CPU components.

## Third assignment 

Create the final CPU components and combine them all in order to make the CPU.
